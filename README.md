# image-similarity-identification
Checking Image Similarity and Identifying Same but Transformed Images based on Different Algorithms.

Implemented algorithms, as of now:
    i. Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM)
    ii. Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB)
    iii. Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Tested on Fish-eye Images taken by Mavic Air 3 against Undistorted versions of same Images generated by DJI Terra (that for some reason changes image names)

Steps to run (Tested on Python 3.8+):
```
conda create --name img_similarity
conda activate -img_similarity

pip install -r requirements.txt

python app.py --original_folder <path_to_original_folder> --target_matching_folder <path_to_target_matching_folder> [--is_rotation] [--method <orb|ssim|mse>] [--crop_percentage <percentage>] [--save_result]

```
